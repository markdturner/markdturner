# About Me

I joined Newcastle University in 2012 and worked as Software Engineer in the Digital Institute for the last 9 years. I've worked on a number of large research
projects during that time, specialising in web applications and user interface design. I was a founding trustee of the Society of Research Software
Engineering and an active member of national and international RSE communities.
